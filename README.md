# ðŸ“‰ Sales Decline Analysis for a Retail Chain

This project explores the causes behind declining sales in a retail chain using **Python for data preprocessing and analysis** and **Power BI for interactive visualizations**. It provides insights into customer behavior, category performance, and seasonal sales trends to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
